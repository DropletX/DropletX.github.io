            Spatio-temporal consistency is a critical research topic in video generation. A qualified generated video segment must ensure plot plausibility and coherence while maintaining visual consistency of objects and scenes across varying viewpoints. Prior research, especially in open-source projects, primarily focuses on either temporal or spatial consistency, or their basic combination, such as appending a description of a camera movement after a prompt without constraining the outcomes of this movement. However, camera movement may introduce new objects to the scene or eliminate existing ones, thereby overlaying and affecting the preceding narrative. Especially in videos with numerous camera movements, the interplay between multiple plots becomes increasingly complex. This paper introduces and examines integral spatio-temporal consistency, considering the synergy between plot progression and camera techniques, and the long-term impact of prior content on subsequent generation.
            Our research encompasses dataset construction through to the development of the model. Initially, we constructed a DropletVideo-10M dataset, which comprises 10 million videos featuring dynamic camera motion and object actions. Each video is annotated with an average caption of 206 words, detailing various camera movements and plot developments. Following this, we developed and trained the DropletVideo model, which excels in preserving spatio-temporal coherence during video generation.

                <b>DropletVideo-10M Caption:</b>
                This video captures a scene of a man walking on a city street at night. The lighting is dim, but the background streets and buildings remain clearly visible.
               <br>
               The video begins on a nighttime city street, where a man wearing a T-shirt with a colorful pattern and a clip-on microphone appears in front of the camera. His face is blurred. In the background, there are shop windows displaying colorful merchandise, and across the street, there is a roadway with vehicles moving slowly. Streetlights and headlights provide faint illumination to the street.
               <br>
               <span style="color: red;">As the man walks while facing the camera</span>, more details of the buildings in the background become visible. A blue sedan passes by on the street, and the shadows of the vehicles flicker on the ground under the lights.
               <br>
               Then, <span style="color: red;">the camera pans to the right</span>, revealing a new scene. Another man wearing a black T-shirt enters the frame, walking near the entrance of a store that emits a bright white light from above. At the same time, pedestrians on both sides of the street come into view, and their shadows on the ground become more distinct.
               <br>
               <span style="color: red;">As the scene transitions</span>, the camera captures a brightly lit urban district with heavy traffic. A blue SUV is seen queued behind a silver car as vehicles move forward slowly. At this moment, the main subject is shown from behind, walking along a crowded sidewalk. The background consists of trees and building facades adorned with green plants inside the walls.
               <br>
               Following the pedestrian’s movement, <span style="color: red;">the camera continues along the street</span>, where traffic remains steady. There are many parked cars along the roadside, including a black sedan.
               <br>
               Towards the end of the video, the man continues walking along the same sidewalk. The background features a row of shops, with customers lingering outside and chatting. The surroundings remain lively with the bustling city atmosphere under the night sky.
               <br>
               Finally, <span style="color: red;">the camera pulls back towards the side of the street</span>, showing the opposite side still busy with traffic and the flashing city lights.

          <b>DropletVideo-10M</b> dataset presents a novel avenue for the investigation of comprehensive spatio-temporal consistency in video generation. It comprises 10 million spatio-temporal videos, each accompanied by an average caption length of 206 words. When contrasted with the Panda70M dataset, the captions in our videos demonstrate a significantly higher degree of spatio-temporal information, as indicated by the highlighted text in red.

           <b>The DropletVideo-10M dataset features diverse camera movements, long-captioned contextual descriptions, and strong spatio-temporal consistency. Existing datasets, such as Panda-70M, place less emphasis on camera movement and contain relatively brief captions. 
              In contrast, DropletVideo-10M consists of spatio-temporal videos that incorporate both camera movement and event progression. Each video is paired with a caption that conveys detailed spatio-temporal information aligned with the video content, with an average caption length of 206 words. 
              The spatio-temporal information is highlighted in red in the figure.

            DropletVideo focuses on integral spatio-temporal consistency during video generation. It addresses the spatial distortion issues caused by camera movement, ensuring smooth plot progression during camera movement and the spatio-temporal consistency of objects within the scene. More importantly, in the development of a video scenario, the emerging scenes do not affect the behavior of the original video objects.

The background is a vast snowy plain dotted with pine trees, and the afterglow of the setting sun in the sky sprinkles a gentle glow. The video begins with the glass snowflake in the center of the frame, with sunlight passing through its transparent body, making it shine with colorful light. 
              The snowflake's design is detailed, with clear edges and corners. The camera slowly rotates to the right around the snowflake, the distant pine trees are naturally distributed, appearing somewhat bent under the weight of the snow on the layered slopes. The camera continues to slowly rotate to the right and around the snowflake, another mountain view gradually comes into sight, with a few tall pine trees standing on the hilltop. On the horizon, the sun is about to set, and the remaining light turns the sky from light blue to warm orange. 
              The camera continues to slowly rotate to the right around the snowflake, finally, the frame stays on the central glass snowflake, where the distant mountain top meets the horizon, and sunlight reflects on the snow.

            DropletVideo manages the pace of plot advancement and camera angle shifts by adjusting a motion control parameter. In the exemplified scenario, augmenting this parameter permits a video of equivalent length to incorporate a greater number of plot components. The video above showcases the video generation results under varying motion control parameters using identical text-image input. Under fps=8 setting, the camera's motion is apparently larger than fps=12 and fps=16, where the snowflake is seen in a perspective with a larger wide range of changes. The motion density decreases as the fps increases from 8 to 16, which confirms that using a smaller fps results into a video with much severe camera variations. This indicates that DropletVideo can proficiently modulate the playback speed of the content while preserving semantic precision.

As the camera slowly pans to the right, soft light filters through the droplets, refracting into subtle colorful halos. The focus naturally shifts from the flowing droplets on the left leaf to the center of the right leaf, where several crystal-clear droplets are neatly aligned along the main vein. As the movement continues, the left leaf’s edge gradually fades out of the frame, while the right leaf’s intricate texture becomes more defined, revealing delicate reflections within the water droplets.

              The video showcases an elegant indoor spiral staircase. The initial frame is a static wide-angle shot, clearly presenting the staircase’s structure: vibrant red carpeting covers the steps, while both sides feature intricately designed wrought iron railings with graceful curves. The staircase spirals upward, extending beyond the frame, with a sturdy wooden support column prominently visible, emphasizing its structural stability. Next, the camera smoothly moves upward along the staircase, tilting slightly to the left, making the red-carpeted steps appear taller while also highlighting the delicate ironwork patterns on the railings. The camera then continues its upward movement, gradually revealing the top section of the staircase, where soft wall lighting casts a warm and inviting ambiance. Toward the end, the camera settles at a mid-level perspective, capturing a slightly protruding white decorative element on the upper wall and a dark hanging light fixture at the top. The video concludes with this harmonious composition, emphasizing the staircase’s refined craftsmanship and architectural beauty.

At the start of the video, the chef is wearing a tall white chef's hat, a black chef's coat, and a white apron, standing in front of the central kitchen counter.

These ingredients include red tomatoes, yellow peppers, green cucumbers, and a tall green cauliflower. The vegetables are colorful and neatly arranged. In the background, you can see the metal exhaust hood and several modern stainless-steel kitchen appliances. The kitchen is empty except for the chef, who is working attentively. As the video progresses, the camera slowly pans to the right, and

              A tranquil and beautiful snow scene, with a delicate glass snowflake placed in the center on soft snow. The background is a vast snowy plain dotted with pine trees, and the afterglow of the setting sun in the sky sprinkles a gentle glow. The video begins with the glass snowflake in the center of the frame, with sunlight passing through its transparent body, making it shine with colorful light. The snowflake's design is detailed, with clear edges and corners. The camera slowly rotates to the right around the snowflake, the distant pine trees are naturally distributed, appearing somewhat bent under the weight of the snow on the layered slopes. The camera continues to slowly rotate to the right and around the snowflake, another mountain view gradually comes into sight, with a few tall pine trees standing on the hilltop. On the horizon, the sun is about to set, and the remaining light turns the sky from light blue to warm orange. 
              <span style="color: red;">The camera continues to slowly rotate to the right around the snowflake, </span>
              finally, the frame stays on the central glass snowflake, where the distant mountain top meets the horizon, and sunlight reflects on the snow.

              The video showcases an elegant indoor spiral staircase. The initial frame is a static wide-angle shot, clearly presenting the staircase’s structure: vibrant red carpeting covers the steps, while both sides feature intricately designed wrought iron railings with graceful curves. The staircase spirals upward, extending beyond the frame, with a sturdy wooden support column prominently visible, emphasizing its structural stability. Next, the camera smoothly moves upward along the staircase, tilting slightly to the left, making the red-carpeted steps appear taller while also highlighting the delicate ironwork patterns on the railings. The camera then continues its upward movement, gradually revealing the top section of the staircase, where 
              Toward the end, the camera settles at a mid-level perspective, capturing a slightly protruding white decorative element on the upper wall and a dark hanging light fixture at the top.
              <span style="color: red;">soft wall lighting casts a warm and inviting ambiance. </span>
               The video concludes with this harmonious composition, emphasizing the staircase’s refined craftsmanship and architectural beauty.

              The video presents a serene and beautiful sunset scene, capturing a flock of birds soaring gracefully under the evening sun, creating a stunning visual. The sun is slowly descending towards the horizon, painting the entire sky in warm shades of orange and red. The clouds, illuminated by the sunset, glow in golden hues, adding to the magnificent scenery.
              At the center of the frame stands a solitary tree, its branches appearing particularly distinct against the backdrop of the setting sun. As the camera moves slowly, a rolling grassland gradually emerges on the left side of the frame. The grassland, bathed in the sunset’s afterglow, displays varying shades of light and shadow, adding a rhythmic natural beauty to the scene.
              As the camera continues to <span style="color: red;">pan left </span>, the flight path of the birds becomes increasingly visible, forming a bright arc under the glow of the sunset and enhancing the dynamic beauty of the composition. Further along,<span style="color: red;"> another tree</span> appears in the frame, its silhouette sharply defined under the warm hues of the setting sun, with crisp and well-defined lines.
